            Hello, my name is Louis Lassegue and I'm from New Jersey. I enjoy traveling and eating food from around the
            world. My favorite places to visit in the states with great food are D.C., New Orleans and San Francisco. In
            the future I would like to travel to Japan, Egypt and Ghana.
