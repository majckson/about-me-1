### Reflections and Comments
* I realize why and how to use `.toUpperCase()` and `.toLowerCase()` it convert the out put to upper or lower case.
* It took me a few minutes to understand `if` statments, but the examples in class on VSC help me understand. 
* The more on hand coding I do, makes me feel better about coding and understanding it.
